    "## Slava's glass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slava walked down the corridor, clutching his trophy ‚Äî the Glass. The twisted halls were behind him, traps dismantled, Bayesian illusions avoided. Ahead ‚Äî a heavy wooden door with a sign that read \"Exit.\" Freedom. Victory. Light.\n",
    "\n",
    "But just as he reached for the handle, the air shimmered. The walls groaned, and the scent of chalk filled the space, as if someone had just solved an infinite system of equations.\n",
    "Out of the shadows stepped Roman ‚Äî draped in a black robe, a scroll under his arm, and eyes sharp enough to slice through any neural net.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slava knew him. Knew him from the university days.\n",
    "They said Roman could prove a theorem before it was even formulated.\n",
    "They said he could see the loss function of reality.\n",
    "The Mathematical Mage.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Äî ‚ÄúWanna play a game?‚Äù Roman asked, and with a flick of his wrist, the Glass vanished from Slava‚Äôs hand and reappeared in Roman‚Äôs.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Äî ‚ÄúNot bad. You escaped my labyrinth. But if you want to leave this place with your precious...‚Äù\n",
    "He tossed the glass and caught it casually.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Äî ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to impress me.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "From his sleeve, Roman pulled out a deck of old cards. He snapped his fingers ‚Äî and the deck exploded into glowing fragments, scattering through the room like data points in chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Äî ‚ÄúBring me this deck ‚Äî whole, complete, and intact. Not just gathered. Understood.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "Slava took a deep breath. He knew this was the final challenge. The hardest one.\n",
    "He opened his laptop, put on his headphones ‚Äî and in his ears began the final lines of Al Pacino‚Äôs legendary speech:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÄúI mean one-half a step too late, or too early, and you don‚Äôt quite make it. One-half second too slow, too fast, you don‚Äôt quite catch it. The inches we need are everywhere around us. They‚Äôre in every break of the game, every minute, every second. On this team, we fight for that inch. On this team, we tear ourselves and everyone else around us to pieces for that inch. We claw with our fingernails for that inch, because we know when we add up all those inches that‚Äôs gonna make the f**** difference between winning and losing! Between livin' and dyin'!‚Äù\n",
